# Handwritten Digit Classification using ANN on MNIST Dataset

This project implements a fully connected Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model achieves approximately **97% accuracy** on the test set, showcasing the effectiveness of ANN on this classic image classification task.

## Overview

Handwritten digit recognition is a foundational problem in computer vision and machine learning. Using the MNIST dataset of grayscale 28x28 pixel images, this project demonstrates how an ANN can be trained from scratch to accurately classify digits (0–9) with strong performance.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 labeled images of handwritten digits, split into:

* **Training set:** 60,000 samples
* **Test set:** 10,000 samples

Images are loaded directly via Keras:

```python
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
```

Each image is flattened from 28x28 into a 784-element vector to serve as input to the ANN.

## Model Architecture

The ANN consists of:

* **Input layer:** Flattened pixel vectors (784 features)
* **Hidden layers:** Fully connected layers with nonlinear activations (e.g., ReLU)
* **Output layer:** 10 neurons with softmax activation for multi-class classification

The network is trained using supervised learning to minimize categorical cross-entropy loss.

## Training Details

* **Optimizer:** Adam optimizer for adaptive learning rate optimization
* **Loss function:** Categorical cross-entropy suited for multi-class classification
* **Epochs:** Tuned to achieve convergence without overfitting
* **Batch size:** Mini-batch gradient descent applied for stable and efficient training

## Results

* **Test accuracy:** \~97%
* The model reliably classifies handwritten digits with high confidence despite input variability.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies (TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, etc.).
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the ANN model.
4. Experiment with hyperparameters or extend the model for further improvements.

## Potential Improvements

* Incorporate regularization techniques like dropout to reduce overfitting.
* Explore deeper networks or alternative activation functions.
* Use data preprocessing or normalization to improve convergence speed.
